# RedSpot

## Overview

### Get Started Immediately

```
$ npx redspot-new erc20
```

(npx is a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, it ensures that you always install the latest version)

Redspot will create a directory called flipper inside the current folder.

Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:

```
$ cd erc20
```

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

#### `npx redspot compile`

Compile your contract into wasm

#### `npx redspot test`

Test your contract

#### `npx redspot console`

Open the interactive javascript console

#### `npx redspot help`

### Install from template

Redspot provides several contract templates: `flipper`, `delegator` , `dns`, `erc20`, `erc721` , `incrementer`, `multisig_plain`. You can intall them like this:

```
$ npx redspot-new <app-name> --template <template-name>
```

For instance: `npx redspot-new flipper --template flipper`

The default contract template is `erc20`.

### Directory tree

```
app-name/
    |-.vscode/
        |-launch.json
    |-artifacts/
        |- <would store compile contract artifacts, e.g. contracts abi(json) and wasm files>
    |-contracts/
    		|-lib.rs
        |-Cargo.toml
    |-scripts
    		|-deploy.ts
    |-node_modules/
        |- ...
    |-tests/
        |-<template-name>.test.ts
    |-package.json
    |-redspot.config.js
    |-tsconfig.json
```

- The files generated by `npx redspot compile` are in `artifacts` folder by default. There are compile artifacts for contracts, like contract **abi and wasm** files.
- `test` keeps test files. There are used for test contracts.

### Compile contract

Use command `npx redspot compile` to compile the contracts and abi files used for generating contracts in project. This command can compile both main contract and sub-contract, but please notice that it can only produce the abi files of the main contract. (Will be resolved in the future https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract/issues/60)

Prerequisites:

- rust nightly: https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/index.html#installing-nightly
- rust-src: `rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly`
- wasm-opt: https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen#tools
- cargo contract v0.7.1: `cargo install --git https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract cargo-contract --force`

You can specify the contract name to compile, by default it compiles all contracts in the workspace.

```
$ npx redspot compile --package <ContractName>
```

You can also specify the toolchain needed by compilation:

```
$ npx redspot compile --toolchain stable
```

You can also set the default toolchain, see [rust.toolchain](#rust.toolchain)

The files generated by compilation will be in `artifacts` directory by default.

### Testing contract

The sample project comes with these tests that use `@redspot/patract`.

```javascript
import BN from "bn.js";
import { patract } from "redspot";
import { expect } from "chai";

const {
  disconnect,
  getContractFactory,
  getRandomSigner,
  getSigners,
  getAbi,
  api,
} = patract!;

describe("ERC20", () => {
  after(() => {
    return disconnect();
  });

  async function setup() {
    const one = new BN(10).pow(new BN(api.registry.chainDecimals));
    const signers = await getSigners();
    const Alice = signers[0];
    const sender = await getRandomSigner(Alice, one.muln(10));
    const contractFactory = await getContractFactory("erc20", sender);
    const contract = await contractFactory.deploy("new", "1000");
    const abi = getAbi("erc20");
    const receiver = await getRandomSigner();

    return { sender, contractFactory, contract, abi, receiver, Alice, one };
  }

  it("Assigns initial balance", async () => {
    const { contract, sender } = await setup();
    const result = await contract.query.balanceOf(sender.address);
    expect(result?.output?.toString()).to.equal("1000");
  });

  it("Transfer adds amount to destination account", async () => {
    const { contract, sender, receiver } = await setup();

    await contract.tx.transfer(receiver.address, 7);

    const result = await contract.query.balanceOf(receiver.address);

    expect(result.output?.toString()).to.equal("7");
  });

  it("Transfer emits event", async () => {
    const { contract, sender, receiver } = await setup();

    const result = await contract.tx.transfer(receiver.address, 7);

    const event = result?.events?.find((e) => e.name === "Transfer");

    const [from, to, value] = event?.args as any;

    expect(from.unwrap().toString()).to.equal(sender.address);
    expect(to.unwrap().toString()).to.equal(receiver.address);
    expect(value.toNumber()).to.equal(7);
  });

  it("Can not transfer above the amount", async () => {
    const { contract, receiver } = await setup();

    const result = await contract.tx.transfer(receiver.address, 1007);

    const event = result?.events?.find((e) => e.name === "Transfer");

    expect(event).to.be.undefined;
  });

  it("Can not transfer from empty account", async () => {
    const { contract, Alice, one, sender } = await setup();

    const emptyAccount = await getRandomSigner(Alice, one.muln(10));

    const result = await contract.tx.transfer(sender.address, 7, {
      signer: emptyAccount,
    });

    const event = result?.events?.find((e) => e.name === "Transfer");

    expect(event).to.be.undefined;
  });
});

```

You can run your tests with `npx redspot test`

```bash
$ npx redspot test

### Deploying contract

To deploy the contract we will use a Hardhat script. Inside scripts/ you will find deploy.ts with the following code:

```javascript
import { patract, network } from "redspot";

const { getContractFactory, disconnect } = patract!;

const uri =
  "bottom drive obey lake curtain smoke basket hold race lonely fit walk//Alice";

const { connect, api } = patract!;

async function run() {
  await connect();

  const signer = network.provider.createSigner(
    network.provider.keyring.createFromUri(uri)
  );

  const contractFactory = await getContractFactory("erc20", signer);

  const balance = await api.query.system.account(signer.address);

  console.log("Balance: ", balance.toHuman());

  const contract = await contractFactory.deployed("new", "1000000", {
    gasLimit: "200000000000",
    value: "10000000000000000",
  });

  console.log("");
  console.log(
    "Deploy successfully. The contract address: ",
    contract.address.toString()
  );

  disconnect();
}

run().catch((err) => {
  console.log(err);
});
```

Run it with `npx redspot run scripts/deploy.ts`:

```bash

ERROR  Disconnected from ws://192.168.1.165:9944: 1000:: Normal connection closure
```

## Configuration

When Redspot is run, it searches for the closest redspot.config.js file starting from the Current Working Directory. This file normally lives in the root of your project. An empty redspot.config.js is enough for Redspot to work.

The entirety of your Redspot setup (i.e. your config, plugins and custom tasks) is contained in this file

### Available config options

To set up your config, you have to export an object from redspot.config.js.

This object can have the following entries: defaultNetwork, networks, and paths. For example:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  defaultNetwork: "development",
  rust: {
    toolchain: "nightly",
  },
  networks: {
    development: {
      endpoint: "ws://127.0.0.1:9944",
      types: {
        Address: "AccountId",
        LookupSource: "AccountId",
      },
      gasLimit: "400000000000",
      explorerUrl: "https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer/query/",
    },
    substrate: {
      endpoint: "ws://127.0.0.1:9944",
      gasLimit: "400000000000",
      accounts: ["//Alice"],
      types: {},
    },
  },
  mocha: {
    timeout: 60000,
  },
};
```

You can get your configuration details via [`env.config`](#config).

### defaultNetwork

You can customize which network is used by default when running Redspot by setting the config's `defaultNetwork` field. If you omit this config, its default value is "localhost".

### networks

The `networks` config field is an optional object where network names map to their configuration.

The default localhost network configuration is:

```javascript
{
  localhost: {
    gasLimit: "400000000000",
    accounts: ["//Alice", "//Bob", "//Charlie", "//Dave", "//Eve", "//Ferdie"],
    endpoint: ["ws://127.0.0.1:9944"],
    types: {},
    httpHeaders: {},
    explorerUrl: "https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer/query/"
  }
}
```

#### [network].gasLimit

This value is used by default when instantiating a contract and invoking a contract transaction.

If this value is too small, you will get a `contracts.OutOfGas` error. The maximum value of gaslimit is `System.MaximumBlockWeight`(In Sustrate, it is `2000000000000`).

#### [network].accounts

The `accounts` should be an array of [suri](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/keyring/start/suri/) or [KeyringPair](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/keyring/start/create#adding-a-pair).

At run time, you can obtain accounts in the form `keyringPair` by `await env.network.provider.getKeyringpairs()`. For details, see [network.provider](#network.provider)

In general, `accounts[0]` is the default signer.

#### [network].endpoint

The endpoint can specify the address of the node to which you want to connect, either `string` or `string[]`

At this time, only WebSockets versions of RPC are supported.

#### [network].types

the `types` are the concepts defined in polkadotjs. If you have any questions about this, you can see it here [types.extend](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/types.extend). You can also set [network].typesbundle, [network].typesSpec and so on. In general, if you encounter an error that is similar to 'No such variant in enum MultiSignature', ,maybe you should think about adding or removing types `{ Address: "AccountId", LookupSource: "AccountId"}`, see [impact-on-extrinsics](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/types.extend#impact-on-extrinsics).

#### [network].httpHeaders

This setting will be added to the webSocket connection headers

#### [network].explorerUrl

This setting is currently used with @redspot/patract. After the transaction is inblock, the console will print the link: `explorerUrl + bloackhash`. The default value is https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer/query/.

### rust.toolchain

This option is used when compiling contracts and exporting metadata. By default the nightly.

### mocha

By default, Redspot uses mocha for testing. You can add mocha configuration here. It is recommended to set a high `timeout` value, otherwise you may often encounter timeout errors. You can find all the configuration items available [here](https://mochajs.org/api/mocha)

### paths

The name of the directories redspot will use. You can override them and change the name you like.

#### paths.artifacts

This directory will hold the artifacts of contract compilation, such as wasm and abi. The default value is "artifacts".

#### paths.sources

Redspot locates your contract file through `Cargo.toml`. First it will look for `Cargo.toml` in the root directory of your project. If it is not found, it will look for `Cargo.toml` in the [paths.sources] directory. You are free to choose what you like. The default value is "contracts".

#### paths.tests

This directory will hold the test files for the contract. The default value is "tests".

#### paths.cache

The commands that you type when you use the `redspot console`. These commands are recorded in the `history` file, which is in this directory. The default value is "cache".

## Runtime Environment

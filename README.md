# RedSpot

## Get Started Immediately

```
$ npx redspot-new erc20
```

(npx is a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, it ensures that you always install the latest version)

Redspot will create a directory called flipper inside the current folder.

Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:

```
$ cd erc20
```

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

#### `npx redspot compile`

Compile your contract into wasm

#### `npx redspot test`

Test your contract

#### `npx redspot console`

Open the interactive javascript console

#### `npx redspot help`

## Install from template

Redspot provides several contract templates: `flipper`, `delegator` , `dns`, `erc20`, `erc721` , `incrementer`, `multisig_plain`. You can intall them like this:

```
$ npx redspot-new <app-name> --template <template-name>
```

For instance: `npx redspot-new flipper --template flipper`

The default contract template is `erc20`.

## Directory tree

```
app-name/
    |-.vscode/
        |-launch.json
    |-artifacts/
        |- <would store compile contract artifacts, e.g. contracts abi(json) and wasm files>
    |-contracts/
    		|-lib.rs
        |-Cargo.toml
    |-scripts
    		|-deploy.ts
    |-node_modules/
        |- ...
    |-tests/
        |-<template-name>.test.ts
    |-package.json
    |-redspot.config.js
    |-tsconfig.json
```

- The files generated by `npx redspot compile` are in `artifacts` folder by default. There are compile artifacts for contracts, like contract **abi and wasm** files.
- `test` keeps test files. There are used for test contracts. 

## Compile contract

Use command `npx redspot compile` to compile the contracts and abi files used for generating contracts in project. This command can compile both main contract and sub-contract, but please notice that it can only produce the abi files of the main contract. (Will be resolved in the future https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract/issues/60)

Prerequisites:

- rust-src: `rustup component add rust-src`
- wasm-opt: https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen#tools
- cargo contract v0.7.0: `cargo install --git https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract cargo-contract --force`
- rust nightly: https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/index.html#installing-nightly

You can specify the contract name to compile, by default it compiles all contracts in the workspace.

```
$ npx redspot compile --package <ContractName>
```

You can also specify the toolchain needed by compilation. The default one is nightly:

```
$ npx redspot compile --toolchain stable
```

The files generated by compilation will be in `artifacts` directory by default.
